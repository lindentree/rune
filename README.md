# Project Overview

This is a mini-project to learn the basics of the Rust programming language. 
It currently consists of a web server that serves: static files, a basic input form, and a GraphiQL interface.

# Setup

This project requires the Rust toolchain be installed on your computer.

After Rust/Cargo is installed, git clone this repo, cd into the root folder, and run `cargo run` in your terminal to compile the Rust code and start up the server.
